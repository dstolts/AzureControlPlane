# AzureControlPlane
Azure Control Plane In-A-Box   ETA May 1st 2019

##Problem Statement##
There are a massive number of companies that are required to implement infrastructure in a secure way adopting Azure.  Azure as a platform is very secure but the security of any system is only as strong as the weakest link.  It is a huge challenge for companies to understand what they need to do to deploy resources securely into Azure while meeting regulatory compliance and preventing mistakes or bad actors from compromising parts of the system.  The time it takes to do this is often measured in months even with full teams working on the solution.  We (all Microsoft customers) need an easy onramp to put workloads into Azure and make sure guard rails and remediations are implemented to make sure they stay secure and compliant. 

##Project Goals## 
Auto-deployment of Control Plane Security Policies MVP/Proof of Concept â€“ 5 Workloads to start
Auto-deployment of infrastructure for testing to confirm proper configuration of security policies
Allow user to *select* and customize policies for workload(s) they wish to deploy. (Self-Service Portal)
Provide options to easily modify standard/default options on the fly
Provide a way to *save* configuration so it can be restored, tweaked and run again
Hack-in-a-box: Instructions and resource to run a 5-day hack where the outcome is 2-3 workloads running securely in Azure with best practices and policies implemented
Inspire and recruit community development efforts
Leverage existing Open Source Projects as much as possible
